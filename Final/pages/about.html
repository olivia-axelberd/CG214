    <p><i>Healing</i> is an ongoing photo series by Olivia Axelberd. The project is a series of environmental portraits of women who have an involvement in "alternative" methods of healing. These methods include synergy, yoga, art, and herbalism. Each woman was photographed in a location she found herself comfortable in and in doing so the goal was to make them feel empowered and good about themselves. There is also an informative aspect of this project that serves to make others aware of this subculture.
