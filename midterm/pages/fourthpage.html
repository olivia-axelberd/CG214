        <p>In 2008 my family and I extended our Arizona visits and started going to California. My parents and I drove from Arizona to California with my grandparents for three summers in a row. Some of my best memories are from these trips. The first year we visited the San Diego Zoo and other attractions in the San Diego area.

        The condo we rented was right across from the beach looking out onto the ocean. Every night we went to bed with the windows open, listening to the sound of the waves crashing on shore. Here are my parents sitting on the deck overlooking the beach. </p>
