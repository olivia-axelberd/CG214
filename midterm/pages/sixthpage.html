        <h2>Cynthi and Lon</h2>
        <p>Another thing about being an only child is that my parents became my best friends. I never felt like I was missing out on anything by not having any siblings because I grew up with an amazing relationship with both of my parents. To this day I still believe they are the coolest people I will ever meet.</p>
