        <p>Most of the cousins in my family are boys. Up until 5 years ago there were only two of us girls so we had to stick together. Sarah grew up in New Jersey but everytime we saw each other it was like we saw each other every day. We used to write each other letters when we couldn't see each other and fill them with drawings and other things.  </p>
