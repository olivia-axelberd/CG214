        <p>One of my earliest memories is from a local amusement park on Long Island called Adventureland. My grandparents took my cousins and I there when we were little. Only two of us were old enough to ride the Ferris wheel so we went on with my grandma. I remember looking for my grandpa and youngest cousin as we went around. We stopped at the top and my cousin and I started shaking the booth we were in, thinking it was the funniest thing in the world. We were having a blast while Grams was panicking. </p>
        
        Here's us on another ride.
