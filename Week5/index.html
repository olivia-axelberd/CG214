        <h1>My Favorite Chrome Experiment.</h1>
        <p>The Chrome experiment I found most intriguing was "Solace: an Interactive Film" by Evan Boehm and Nexus Studios. I thought this experiment was really interesting because it was an interactive film which told a story while allowing you to take part. This was unlike most of the other experiments that just allowed you to move things around. Overall, I thought it was a really fun and innovative way to take a story and video to a new level.</p>
        
        <div>
        <p>Here are some of my favorite aspects of experiment:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>It tells an interesting fictional short story</li>
                <li>The colors are consistent and cohesive</li>
                <li>Before the story starts you are guided through what interactive moves you can make</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <br/>
        <p>Here is a screenshot from the video. Interesting characters such as this one appear throughout the video that you can interact with.</p>

        <p>This is the audio from the first 20 seconds of the video. The entire video plays out as this type of friendly conversation.</p>
